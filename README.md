This was the first task of Sparks Foundation Internship in which we had to predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours. It was a simple linear regression task involving only 2 variables.

 ## Observation
 * A positive linear correlation graph was observed after plotting the number of hours studied and the student's performance.
 * Some predictions were also performed using the test set as well as my own data to obtain the percentage scored.
